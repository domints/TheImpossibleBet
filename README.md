# The Impossible Bet
Simple application to test solution to The Impossible Bet Problem.
Other name of this problem is 100 prisoners problem.

The 100 prisoners problem is a mathematical problem in probability theory and combinatorics. In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in order to survive. The rules state that each prisoner may open only 50 drawers and cannot communicate with other prisoners. At first glance, the situation appears hopeless, but a clever strategy offers the prisoners a realistic chance of survival. Danish computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen first proposed the problem in 2003.

# Solutions
Program tests two possible solutions: Random, where each person chooses random 50 boxes and strategic, where each person tries to follow the chain of boxes to find their own.

Description of the strategy is given here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5-I0bAuEUE

Presumably, random approach is almost impossible to win, while strategy gives over 31% chance of winning.
